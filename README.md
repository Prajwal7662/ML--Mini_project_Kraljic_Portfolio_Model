# Supplier Classification using Kraljic Portfolio Model

## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on **supplier classification** using the **Kraljic Portfolio Model**. The notebook analyzes supplier data to evaluate **supply risk** and **profit impact**, helping organizations make strategic sourcing and procurement decisions.  

## 🎯 Objective
The main objective of this project is to **categorize suppliers** based on their **supply risk** and **profit impact**, and visualize them using the **Kraljic Matrix**. This classification assists in developing effective supplier management strategies and ensuring supply chain resilience.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## 📊 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Calculation of supply risk and profit impact scores  
- Visualization of supplier segmentation using the Kraljic Matrix  
- Insights and recommendations for supplier management
